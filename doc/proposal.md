**Objective: **Designing an object oriented software for the representation of the jobs and clusters.

**Motivation: **High performance computing (HPC) is a branch of computer science that is still open to development and has certain possibilities. The solution that will be obtained by using design patterns can take part in many projects in the future.

**Problem: **HPC is basically the general name given to the clusters of computers created by combining a large number of computers that work together, where a single computer cannot provide the required performance. The computing power demand as a CPU and GPU that occurs during the HPC process is too high and unpredictable. The server requirements to be allocated to the user during HPC operation are already assigned and must be calculated before starting the operation.

**Solutions: **In order to utilize the HPC systems more efficient, it is necessary to decide on job running parameters in a resource aware manner. For this purpose,  a resource aware scheduling module will be developed, that can track the status of a representative HPC cluster and meanwhile, adjust the job parameters in real time using object oriented programming techniques and various design patterns.

**Expected outcomes:**

● Usage of five or more design patterns

● Using Java APIs for cluster monitoring and job scheduling

● Finding effective class implementation in job transaction
